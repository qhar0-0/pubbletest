WARNING:
THIS GAME CONTAINS MANY ERRORS DUE TO IT BEING CODED IN GAMEMAKER AND MAY GIVE A BLACK SCREEN WHEN A CERTAIN BUTTON IS PRESSED (i.e return to menu in game, load data button, etc.) AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT!
When exporting the gamemaker project as an html5 game it caused many errors in the code due to the massive difference between gamemaker code standards and HTML5 code standards. There is also immense lag so again I apologize

This game was a game a friend and I made for a game jam a while ago. Many small animations had to be removed in order to even get this game to work on html5 so it may not look good but it works much better as an application (to be added on github here).
